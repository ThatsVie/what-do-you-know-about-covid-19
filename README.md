## Current Limitations

1. **Swagger Documentation**: Currently works locally but is not functional on the deployed site.
2. **Logging**: File-based logging was disabled due to deployment conflicts with Vercel. Logs are not currently accessible but restoring logging functionality is a priority.

## Future Enhancements

- **Re-enable Swagger**: Make API documentation accessible in the deployed environment.
- **Improve Logging**: Implement a logging solution compatible with serverless deployment.
- **User Features**: Add login functionality for saved articles and personalized experiences.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSockets to notify users of newly added articles.
- **More Advocacy Tools**: Expand the platform to include guides for community action.
