Diagnostic methods, including Amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, plasma biomarker testing, and MRI imaging, revealed AD-like symptoms with significant demyelination in cerebral white matter. No genetic origins were identified, and her APOE genotype was ε3/ε3. The findings suggest oligodendrocytes as a major source of amyloid and Tau proteins, likely triggered by COVID-19 infection or vaccination through blood-brain barrier damage. This case introduces the term 'AD-like COVID syndromes,' proposing a distinct subset of long COVID characterized by AD-like neurodegenerative symptoms. The report underscores the need for further research into post-COVID neurological impacts.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5549836/v1","2024-12-17"

The research followed 16 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 and revealed higher maternal IL-6 levels at delivery, which correlated with delayed communication and problem-solving scores in infants at 12 months. DNA methylation patterns in exposed infants also differed, particularly in genes associated with brain development. While differences were subtle and not universal, the findings emphasize the need to protect pregnant people from severe viral infections. Researchers are conducting ongoing four-year follow-ups to identify potential long-term developmental disorders and promote early intervention.","https://www.monash.edu/medicine/news/latest/2024-articles/monash-study-links-severe-maternal-covid-19-to-infant-developmental-delays","2024-12-17"

This discovery reveals that genetic variants of the IFNAR2 protein, influenced by transposons, can act as a decoy to interfere with immune signaling. Abnormal balances of these variants may make individuals more susceptible to severe COVID-19, chronic inflammation, or autoimmune diseases. Manipulating this 'dial' could lead to new treatments for infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.","https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-12-immune-tuning-dial-covid-sicker.html","2024-12-17"
