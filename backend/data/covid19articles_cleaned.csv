Kahlert, MD; Philipp Kohler, MD, MSc","JAMA Network Open","2022-08-15","2022","Masking","COVID-19, healthcare workers, mask types, patient exposure, respirators","This cohort study analyzed the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) based on cumulative patient exposure and mask type preference. HCWs using respirators (FFP2) showed over 40% lower odds of infection compared to those using surgical or mixed masks, even with increased exposure. Factors such as positive household contacts and vaccination also influenced infection odds. The study highlights the dose-response association between patient exposure and infection risk, suggesting respirators and vaccination as effective protective measures.","https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2795150","2024-12-02"
"U.S. Companies Shifted To Make N95 Respirators During COVID. Now, They're Struggling","Monika Evstatieva","NPR","2021-06-25","2021","Masking","N95 masks, domestic manufacturing, supply chain, economic struggles","This article discusses the struggles of U.S. companies that shifted to manufacture N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite stepping up during a national crisis, many manufacturers are now facing financial hardship due to reduced demand, competition from cheaper foreign imports, and lack of government support. Business leaders and industry experts highlight the risks of foreign dependency and the need for long-term strategies to support domestic production.","https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1009858893/u-s-companies-shifted-to-make-n95-respirators-during-covid-now-theyre-struggling","2024-12-02"
