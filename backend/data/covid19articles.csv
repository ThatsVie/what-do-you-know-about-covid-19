The researchers used A549 lung cells, which were treated with nicotine to assess its impact on ACE2 expression—the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The study found that nicotine directly upregulated ACE2 at both the gene and protein levels. This increased ACE2 expression made the cells more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. While the findings highlight the potential risks associated with nicotine exposure in relation to COVID-19, they do not directly address the effects of cigarette smoking, which involves additional substances beyond nicotine.

The trial, led by Dr. Amy Proal and involving experts like Dr. David Putrino and Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, explores whether low-dose rapamycin (Sirolimus) can improve symptoms in long COVID patients. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor with known antiviral properties, is hypothesized to benefit long COVID patients by targeting T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, including Epstein-Barr virus reactivation and SARS-CoV-2 remnants. Blood samples from participants will be analyzed to observe immune parameter changes. Rapamycin has been shown in other studies to enhance immune function and reduce inflammation at low doses, with minimal side effects. The trial builds on evidence from preclinical studies and previous clinical observations of rapamycin's benefits in managing viral and age-related immune dysfunction.","https://polybio.org/projects/long-covid-low-dose-rapamycin-clinical-trial/","2024-12-27"

Activity levels increased significantly, cognitive function improved, and the patient was able to resume work part-time. This study suggests that enoxaparin may address underlying hypercoagulation and microclot formation in Long COVID, paving the way for further clinical trials to explore its effectiveness.","https://doi.org/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000276","2025-01-02"

The research analyzes 25 cases of hepatitis within 90 days post-vaccination, identifying hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, vaccine-induced liver injury (VILI), and immune-related hepatitis as primary causes. HBV reactivation accounted for 90% of hepatitis cases among patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Patients with severe liver injury exhibited significantly elevated AST levels (>500 U/L). Two fatalities occurred despite prompt treatment. The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring liver function and HBV DNA levels post-vaccination, particularly in regions with high HBV prevalence.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2023.06.007","2025-01-02"

Enteric viruses, traditionally believed to spread via fecal-oral transmission, were found to productively replicate in salivary glands and be transmitted via saliva. This finding has significant implications for public health, especially in the context of diseases like COVID-19, as saliva testing is commonly used for diagnosing viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The study stresses the need for sanitation measures beyond traditional fecal contamination prevention, focusing on saliva as a conduit for transmission. It also highlights the potential for developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to target this novel pathway.","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04895-8","2025-01-02"

Outdoors, transmission is significantly less likely due to rapid aerosol dispersion, better air circulation, and environmental factors such as sunlight and wind. However, the study notes that outdoor transmission is not impossible and can occur in scenarios such as high-density gatherings with prolonged exposure and low mask usage. The findings stress the importance of ventilation and other mitigation strategies indoors and offer insights into the dynamics of airborne transmission.","https://doi.org/10.3390/fluids9030054","2025-01-02"
