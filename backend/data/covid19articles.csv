MIS affects various body parts, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. It occurs in children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A), with MIS-C being more common. Risk factors include recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prevention focuses on COVID-19 vaccination and protective measures.","https://www.cdc.gov/mis/about/index.html","2024-12-07"
